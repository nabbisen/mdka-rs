## ✨ Contributing

We’re happy to receive feedback, bug reports, and questions via GitHub Issues.  
Pull requests are also welcome — though please note that we may not always be able to accept them.

This project is maintained as a labor of love. We welcome community participation, but:

- Issues that are respectful and constructive are appreciated.
- Pull requests are reviewed, but acceptance is not guaranteed.
- We do not engage in long debates or vision disagreements.
- If you have a different direction in mind, please fork freely, provided proper licensing is respected.

Thanks for understanding the scope and spirit of the project.
