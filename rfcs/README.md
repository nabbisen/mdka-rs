# mdka RFCs

Design records for the mdka project. Lifecycle, folder semantics, and naming are
governed by [RFC 000](./done/000-rfc-lifecycle-policy.md).

**The folder is the source of truth for an RFC's state.** Each file's `Status`
field mirrors its folder; if the two ever disagree, the folder wins.

Planning context for the whole portfolio lives in [`ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md).

## Reserved numbers

These numbers are allocated in the roadmap but not yet drafted. Each is written
at the start of its milestone, so its design reflects what the preceding
milestone actually shipped. Numbers are permanent and are never reused.
